Duplicate code fragment linting? I tried this jscpd thing but it didn't work with nvim-lint out of the box
There is also sonar, but be careful not to mess up your existing dev env

We may not need the lspconfig plugin anymore with 0.12
We need some way to make the lsp file more maintainable
ideas would be to break the diagnostics into a separate file
or to put the server configs into their own file
see maria solano config
or put the telescope stuff in telescope, see kickstart

try out gray for the diagnostic hint color

git changed color to blue

it would be sick if unnest stayed in the toggle terminal

The LSP signature help is backward

todo-comments is not highlighting in diffview

new blame options in gitsigns

the qflist enter doesn't work because of my custom enter keybind

upstream your gf diffview keybind

want a more graceful solution for unnest
